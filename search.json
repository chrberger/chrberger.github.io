Static loops do not allow SASs to react to runtime events such as changing adaptation requirements or MAPE-K elements' faults. In order to address this issue, some solutions have emerged for manually or automatically perform changes on SASs' feedback loops. However, from the software engineering perspective, most of the proposals cannot be reused or extended by other SASs. In this paper, we present HAFLoop (Highly Adaptive Feedback control Loop), a generic architectural proposal that aims at easing and fastening the design and implementation of adaptive feedback loops in modern SASs. Our solution enables both structural and parameter adaptation of the loop elements. Moreover, it provides a highly modular design that allows SASs' owners to support a variety of feedback loop settings from centralized to fully decentralized. In this work, HAFLoop has been implemented as a framework for Java-based systems and evaluated in two emerging software application domains: self-driving vehicles and IoT networks. Results demonstrate that our proposal easies and accelerates the development of adaptive feedback loops as well as how it could help to address some of the most relevant challenges of self-driving vehicles and IoT applications.

As source code files grow in size, maintainability becomes more challenging. Therefore, it is expected that the density of technical debt in larger files would be reduced for the sake of maintainability. Objective: This exploratory study investigates whether a newly introduced metric 'technical debt density trend' helps to better understand and explain the evolution of technical debt. The 'technical debt density trend' metric is the slope of the line of two successive 'technical debt density' measures corresponding to the 'lines of code' values of two consecutive revisions of a source code file. Method: This study has used 11,822 commits or revisions of 4,013 Java source files from 21 open source projects. For the technical debt measure, SonarQube tool is used with 138 code smells. Results: This study finds that 'technical debt density trend' metric has interesting characteristics that make it particularly attractive to understand the pattern of accrual and repayment of technical debt by breaking down a technical debt measure into multiple components, e.g., 'technical debt density' can be broken down into two components showing mean density corresponding to revisions that accrue technical debt and mean density corresponding to revisions that repay technical debt. The use of 'technical debt density trend' metric helps us understand the evolution of technical debt with greater insights.","tags":null,"title":"Evolution of Technical Debt: An Exploratory Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Henriksson, Jens and Berger, Christian and Borg, Markus and Tornberg, Lars and Sathyamoorthy, Sankar Raman and Englund, Cristofer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"7f6c788c12b639012e537988fc1f3b97","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/hbb+19/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hbb+19/","section":"publication","summary":"Several areas have been improved with Deep Learning during the past years.

We analyse the performance of the supervisor after each epoch during the training cycle, to investigate supervisor performance as the accuracy converges.

In this work, we emphasize the need to assess and compare the performance of supervisors in a structured way.

The vehicle for data collection is typically equipped with a variety of sensors such as camera, LiDAR, radar, GPS, and IMU. The raw data of all sensors is logged on a disk while the vehicle is manually driven. The logged data can be subsequently used for training and testing different algorithms for autonomous driving, e.g., vehicle/pedestrian detection and tracking, SLAM, and motion estimation. Data collection is time-consuming and can sometimes be avoided by directly using existing datasets including sensor data collected by other researchers.

Due to the complexity of the software powering these systems and the dynamicity of the development processes, an architectural solution capable of supporting long-term evolution and maintenance is required. Continuous Experimentation (CE) is an already increasingly adopted practice in software-intensive web-based software systems to steadily improve them over time. CE allows organizations to steer the development efforts by basing decisions on data collected about the system in its field of application. Despite the advantages of Continuous Experimentation, this practice is only rarely adopted in cyber-physical systems and in the automotive domain. Reasons for this include the strict safety constraints and the computational capabilities needed from the target systems. In this work, a concept for using Continuous Experimentation for resource-constrained platforms like a self-driving vehicle is outlined.","tags":null,"title":"Considerations about Continuous Experimentation for Resource-Constrained Platforms in Self-Driving Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Schroeder, Jan and Berger, Christian and Knauss, Alessia and Preenja, Harri and Ali, Mohammad and Staron, Miroslaw and Herpel, Thomas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"b245039cc2f148fd77b98d71313feaad","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/sbk+17b/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sbk+17b/","section":"publication","summary":"The size of a software artifact influences the software quality and impacts the development process. In industry, when software size exceeds certain thresholds, memory errors accumulate and development tools might not be able to cope anymore, resulting in a lengthy program start up times, failing builds, or memory problems at unpredictable times. Thus, foreseeing critical growth in software modules meets a high demand in industrial practice. Predicting the time when the size grows to the level where maintenance is needed prevents unexpected efforts and helps to spot problematic artifacts before they become critical. Although the amount of prediction approaches in literature is vast, it is unclear how well they fit with prerequisites and expectations from practice. In this paper, we perform an industrial case study at an automotive manufacturer to explore applicability and usability of prediction approaches in practice. In a first step, we collect the most relevant prediction approaches from literature, including both, approaches using statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, we elicit expectations towards predictions from practitioners using a survey and stakeholder workshops. At the same time, we measure software size of 48 software artifacts by mining four years of revision history, resulting in 4,547 data points. In the last step, we assess the applicability of state-of-the-art prediction approaches using the collected data by systematically analyzing how well they fulfill the practitioners' expectations. Our main contribution is a comparison of commonly used prediction approaches in a real world industrial setting while considering stakeholder expectations. We show that the approaches provide significantly different results regarding prediction accuracy and that the statistical approaches fit our data best.","tags":null,"title":"Predicting and Evaluating Software Model Growth in the Automotive Industry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yin, Hang and Berger, Christian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"be677c91abcd84e83877750e18b930fb","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/yb17a/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yb17a/","section":"publication","summary":"LiDAR sensors play a crucial role in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. By firing high-rate laser beams, a LiDAR device is able to project its surroundings as 2D or 3D point cloud, which can be used for different purposes such as object detection, map generation, localization, and navigation. Autonomous vehicles are often equipped with at least one multi-layer LiDAR sensor with 360-degree coverage to include as much information as possible in the point cloud. Such a device generates enormous amount of data which poses a challenge for data storage, real-time computation, and data transmission, as autonomous vehicles are typically resource-constrained systems. This paper proposes a lightweight and adaptive point cloud data structure to reduce the size of a 3D point cloud. The suggested data structure can be flexibly configured with different parameters to adapt for precision, distance coverage, and reflectivity resolution. The precision of the data structure is evaluated using a 16-layer Velodyne LiDAR sensor (VLP-16) to collect data in the city area of AstaZero proving ground and Gothenburg downtown. Our results show that the adaptive data structure can consume only 1/8th of the original point cloud size and hence, it is particularly suitable for applications with limited hardware resources or certain tolerance to precision of the point cloud. The suggested concept is also generalizable to other types of point cloud providing sensors.","tags":null,"title":"Mastering Data Complexity for Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Point Clouds for Urban Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Knauss, Alessia and Schroeder, Jan and Berger, Christian and Eriksson, Henrik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"f1d10ad1b50c27a128c71df6990efc82","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/ksbe17/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ksbe17/","section":"publication","summary":"The technology in the area of automated vehicles is gaining speed and promises many advantages.

We used an inductive approach based on empirical data collected during a longitudinal study with six companies in the Nordic region. The data collection took place over two years through focus group workshops, individual on-site interviews, and complementary surveys. The primary benefit of large-scale agile development is improved quality, enabled by practices that support regular or continuous integration between teams delivering software, hardware, and mechanics. In this regard, the most beneficial integration cycle for deliveries is every four weeks; while continuous integra- tion on a daily basis would favor software teams, other disciplines does not seem to benefit from faster integration cycles. We identified 108 goals and development practices supporting agile principles among the companies, most of them concerned with integration; therefrom, 26 agile practices are unique to the mechatronics domain to support adopting agile beyond pure software development teams. 16 of these practices are considered as key enablers, confirmed by our control cases.","tags":null,"title":"Scaling Agile Development in Mechatronic Organizations -- A Comparative Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Knauss, Alessia and Schroeder, Jan and Berger, Christian and Eriksson, Henrik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"4a4fc63411f9060ee7f035a541ff754d","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/ksbe17a/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ksbe17a/","section":"publication","summary":"Automated vehicles are not supposed to fail at any time or in any situations during driving.

Although standard distribution models have been recognized in reliability engineering practice, their ability to fit defect data from proprietary and OSS software projects is not well understood.

We evaluate six standard distributions for their ability to fit the defect inflow data and also assess which information criterion is practical for selecting the distribution with best fit. Our results show that beta distribution provides the best fit to the defect inflow data for all industrial projects as well as majority of OSS projects studied.

Less attention has been given to provide better tools for the SA process itself. One promising approach is to introduce computer-tablets to aid data collection, which has proven to be useful in medical studies. Simple software solutions can eliminate the need to transcribe data and generate more flexible and better maintainable questionnaires. Tablets' technical features envision promising enhancements of SA, which also enable better correlations to objective metrics, a requirement to improve CAE evaluations. However, it cannot be assumed that a tablet-based solution is feasible in vehicle dynamics SA context.

Our position is that without taking a social view for system development and cross-disciplinary research we can only address partial problems related to the digitalization and that by integrating domain-specific disciplines (e.g. financing) with the technology related ones (e.g., software engineering) we could develop holistic solutions for the challenges identified in this paper.","tags":null,"title":"On the role of cross-disciplinary research and SSE in addressing the challenges of the digitalization of society","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bures, Tomas and Weyns, Danny and Berger, Christian and Biffl, Stefan and Daun, Marian and Gabor, Thomas and Garlan, Barnard David and Gerostathopoulos, Ilias and Julien, Christine and Krikava, Filip and Mordinyi, Richard and Pronios, Nikos B."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1446336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446336000,"objectID":"14d504c84ad890730c4d6231270358ea","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/bwb+15/","publishdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bwb+15/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems -- Towards a Research Agenda: Report on the First International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart CPS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berger, Christian and Block, Delf and Heeren, Sönke and Hons, Christian and Kühnel, Stefan and Leschke, André and Plotnikov, Dimitri and Rumpe, Bernhard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"67a19cd0dbc9f5cabe8d6bb687ef107f","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/bbh+15b/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bbh+15b/","section":"publication","summary":"Context: Consumer tests which assess safety features of modern vehicles have a tradition in Europe. Recently, such test protocols have been substantially extended to also cover active safety systems like Volkswagen's Front Assist. Objective: Simulations for passive safety systems are already a widely adopted approach during vehicle development and internal assessments. As active safety systems are becoming an increasingly important element in a vehicle's safety concept and a differentiating feature, a systematic validation and assessment of such systems is necessary to successfully pass consumer tests and complimentarily identified, relevant traffic scenarios. Method: With this work, we extend our previous conference publication about EuroNCAP CCRs tests by additionally investigating US NCAP scenarios for an AEB system. Therefore, we systematically modeled the allowed variations with a graph where the paths represent concrete test scenarios. These paths are used in a virtual test environment to assess the AEB system. In our previous publication, we illustrated our method of test case generation and simulating consumer test scenarios by showing results of 27 specific test cases. In this work, we focused on integrating a test automatization routine as well as evaluating a set of test cases with a factor of 100 compared to our previous paper. Results: We demonstrate the approach for both EuroNCAP's and US NCAP's CCRs scenarios with a total quantity of more than 2,700 test cases including re-runs to systematically evaluate an AEB algorithm. Our results unveiled varying action points in time for the same initial values for a given consumer test scenario while applying different allowed variations. Conclusion: We foresee the importance of complementary virtual testing for real-world tests on proving grounds especially during the design phase. Our study shows that already small variations that yet accord with the test procedure specification influence the behavior of an active safety system and need to be investigated during development and vehicle testing.","tags":null,"title":"Simulations on Consumer Tests: A Systematic Evaluation Approach in an Industrial Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrade, Hugo and Giaimo, Federico and Berger, Christian and Crnkovic, Ivica"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"6e4515e5fec167e35b5f1a293539ba9f","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/agbc15/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/agbc15/","section":"publication","summary":"Cyber-physical systems like robots and self-driving vehicles comprise complex software systems.

Objective: The official EuroNCAP test protocol for Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)/Forward Collision Warning (FCW) systems explicitly defines to what extent a Vehicle-Under-Test (VUT) is allowed to vary in its lateral position. In addition, the United States New Car Assessment Programme (US NCAP) test protocol has broader tolerance ranges. The goal for automotive OEMs is to understand the impact of such allowed variations on a the overall vehicle's performance. Method: A simulation-based approach is outlined that allows systematic, large-scale analysis of such influences to effectively plan time-consuming and resource-intense real-world vehicle tests. Our models allow a profound analysis of an AEB algorithm by modeling and conducting more than 3,000 simulation runs with EuroNCAP's dynamic CCRm and CCRb scenarios including those with adopted USNCAP parameters. Results: Our structured analysis of such test procedures involving dynamic actors is the first of its kind in a relevant industrial setting. Several anomalies were unveiled under US NCAP conditions to support real-world test runs. Hence, we could show that the proposed method supports all possible scenarios in AEB consumer tests and scales as we had to timely process approx. 7.7GB of simulation data. Conclusion: To achieve the expected performance and to study a system's behavior in potential misuse cases from a functional point of view, large scale, model-based simulations complement traditional testing on proving ground.","tags":null,"title":"Large-Scale Evaluation of an Active Safety Algorithm with EuroNCAP and US NCAP Scenarios in a Virtual Test Environment -- An Industrial Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berger, Christian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438387200,"objectID":"6584a4e33479b739d586b0357b498e14","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/ber15b/","publishdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ber15b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Testing Continuous Deployment with Lightweight Multi-Platform Throw-Away Containers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berger, Christian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1430438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430438400,"objectID":"1b01946d06bb07f38ecc04cacae90ddd","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/ber15c/","publishdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ber15c/","section":"publication","summary":"Engineering software for smart cyber-physical systems (sCPS) challenges developers as they have to deal with uncertain and volatile stimuli data perceived by sensors.

For assessing release readiness, the asymptote accuracy is the most important attribute. Although more than hundred models for software reliability have been proposed and evaluated over time, there exists no clear guide on which models should be used for a given software development process or for a given industrial domain. Using defect inflow profiles from large software projects from Ericsson, Volvo Car Corporation and Saab EDS we evaluate commonly used SRGMs for their ability to provide empirical basis for making these decisions.

We evaluate six standard distributions for their ability to fit the defect inflow data and also assess which information criterion is practical for selecting the distribution with best fit. Our results show that beta distribution provides the best fit to the defect inflow data from all projects with different distribution characteristics.

Objective: International competitions like the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge did not focus on efficient usage of resources to realize the self-driving vehicular functionality. Since the automotive industry is very cost-sensitive, realizing reliable and robust self- driving functionality is challenging when expensive and sophisticated sensors mounted very visibly on the vehicle's roof for example cannot be used. Therefore, the goal for this study is to investigate how architectural design decisions of recent self-driving vehicular technology consider resource-efficiency. Method: In a multiple case study, the architectural design decisions derived for resource- constrained self-driving miniature cars for the international competition CaroloCup are compared with architectural designs from recent real-scale self-driving cars. Results: Scaling down available resources for realizing self-driving vehicular technol- ogy puts additional constraints on the architectural design; especially reusability of software components in platform-independent algorithmic concepts are prevailing.

One of the system challenges on the road is that at any time the environment can stop meeting the system's operational conditions (and then resume meeting the requirements at some later point in time). Thus, as vehicles map their surroundings, they should also provide information that can help the vehicles to know whether the operational conditions are met with respect to the confidence that they have about the mapped information. We design and implement key services of Local DynamicMaps (LDMs) that are based on on-board and remote sensory information. The LDM provides the position of all nearby noticeable objects along with the LDM's confidence about these positions. The design also includes an extension that allows the vehicular system to agree on the lowest common ability to meet the operational conditions. We evaluate the performance of a key component in our pilot implementation together with a set of test cases that validate the proposed design.

Machine learning has a potential to address the problem of manual maintenance but can also require changes in how companies works with defect prediction. In this paper we address the problem of identifying what the benefits of machine learning are compared to existing methods and which barriers exist for adopting them in practice. Our methods consist of literature studies and a case study at two companies - Ericsson and Volvo Car Group. By studying literature we develop a framework for adopting machine learning and using case studies we evaluate this framework through a series of four interviews with experts working with predictions at both companies - line manager, quality manager and measurement team leader. The findings of our research show that the most important perceived benefits of adopting machine learning algorithms for defect prediction are accuracy of predictions and ability to generate new insights from data. The two most important perceived barriers in this context are inability to recognize new patterns and low generalizability of the machine learning algorithms. We conclude that in order to support companies in making an informed decision to adopt machine learning techniques for software defect predictions we need to go beyond accuracy and also evaluate factors such as costs, generalizability and competence.","tags":null,"title":"The Adoption of Machine Learning Techniques for Software Defect Prediction: An Initial Industrial Validation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berger, Christian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1404172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404172800,"objectID":"d7096c28cfb5c7fa497711a1ba23b81c","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/ber14c/","publishdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ber14c/","section":"publication","summary":"Today's cyber-physical systems (CPS) like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in modern vehicles use a large variety of sensors to process data from their surroundings.

Such recordings are an ever-growing data source, and thus, effective methods are needed to find proper recordings in databases to support the system validation. Textual annotations for these sensor recordings require a well-defined taxonomy and continuous maintenance. Instead of relying on such a manually maintained taxonomy, an automated method for identifying relevant scenarios from real world sensor recordings by using simulation models is described.

We are using 1:10 scale miniature vehicles as a robotic platform to conduct research in the domain of self-driving cars and collaborative vehicle fleets. Thus, experiments with different sensors like e.g. ultra-sonic, infrared, and rotary encoders need to be prepared and realized using our vehicle platform. For each setup, we need to configure the hardware/software interface board to handle all sensors and actors. Therefore, we need to find a specific configuration setting for each pin of the interface board that can handle our current hardware setup but which is also flexible enough to support further sensors or actors for future use cases. In this paper, we show how to model the domain of the configuration space for a hardware/software interface board to enable model checking for solving the tasks of finding any, all, and the best possible pin configuration. We present results from a formal experiment applying the declarative languages Alloy and Prolog to guide the process of engineering the hardware/software interface for robotic platforms on the example of a configuration complexity up to ten pins resulting in a configuration space greater than 14.5 million possibilities. Our results show that our domain model in Alloy performs better compared to Prolog to find feasible solutions for larger configurations with an average time of 0.58s. To find the best solution, our model for Prolog performs better taking only 1.38s for the largest desired configuration; however, this important use case is currently not covered by the existing tools for the hardware used as an example in this article.","tags":null,"title":"Engineering the Hardware/Software Interface for Robotic Platforms -- A Comparison of Applied Model Checking with Prolog and Alloy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rana, Rakesh and Staron, Miroslaw and Berger, Christian and Hansson, Jörgen and Nilsson, Martin and Törner, Fredrik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1383264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1383264000,"objectID":"b9c949b7f0e75ed0a749d41336c0af99","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/rsb+13/","publishdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rsb+13/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating long-term predictive power of standard reliability growth models on automotive systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rana, Rakesh and Staron, Miroslaw and Berger, Christian and Hansson, Jörgen and Nilsson, Martin and Törner, Fredrik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380585600,"objectID":"fc008b02c95e76ca2d43b9977f9cd3c8","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/rsb+13b/","publishdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rsb+13b/","section":"publication","summary":"Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs) have been used by engineers and managers for tracking and managing the reliability change of software to ensure required standard of quality is achieved before the software is released to the customer.

In this paper, we are presenting an MDE approach for managing different sensor setups in a cyber-physical system development environment to leverage automated model verification, support system testing, and enable code generation. For example, the models are used as the single point of truth to configure and generate sensor setups for system validations in a 3D simulation environment. After their validation, a considered sensor configuration is transformed into a constraint-satisfaction model to be solved by the logical programming language Prolog. Based on this transformation, the conformance to the embedded system specification is formally verified and possible pin assignments, for how to connect the required sensors are calculated.

The amount, complexity and importance of software components within Electrical/Electronics (E/E) systems of modern cars is only increasing with time. Several automotive functions carrying software provide or interact with safety critical systems such as systems steering and braking and thus assuring functional safety for such systems is of high importance. Requirements for the safety assurance are specified partially by such functional safety standards as ISO 26262. The standard provides the framework and guidelines for the development of hardware and software for components deemed to be safety critical. In this chapter we argue that traditional approaches for safety assurance such as fault injection and mutation testing can be adapted and applied to functional models to enable early verification and validation according to the requirements of ISO 26262. We show how to use fault injection in combination with mutation based testing to identify defects early in the development process - both theoretically and on a case of self-driving miniature vehicles. The argument is grounded upon the current best practices within the industry, a study of ISO 26262 standard, and academic and industrial case studies using fault injection and mutation based testing applied to the functional model level.

Instead, simulative environments are used nowadays, which provide the virtual surroundings for such a system where its real input sources are replaced with simplified sensor models. Thus, interactive and hazard-free system tests and automated system evaluations can be carried out easily. However, the simple strategy to run all available modeled traffic scenarios in the simulation on any change of the implementation would consume too much computation time to provide effective and fast feedback for developers. In this article, an improved strategy for selecting scenarios that shall be run in a simulation based on run-time control-flow analysis is proposed, which resulted from the in-depth analysis of the revision history of the source code and their accompanying simulations for two self-driving vehicles.

Hesperia as a cloud-based testing approach was tested 2009 during the development of an autonomously driving vehicle at the University of California, Berkeley.","tags":null,"title":"Cloud-based Testing for Context-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berger, Christian and Siegl, Sebastian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"7d5e167e29fc23bc711ac2e640ddfe00","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/bs12/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bs12/","section":"publication","summary":"Requirements engineering is nowadays the broadly accepted method to manage a customer's requirements. The result is a specification from which a solution is implemented and which is used to validate the realization in terms of their fulfillment. However, today's tools assist in organizing and tracking the requirements but reliable criteria about their completeness, consistency, and realizability are missing. Furthermore, the resulting artifact is a document, which must be read and understood by humans, which itself is error-prone. It is obvious that errors and ambiguities result in an unwanted solution which is often and in the worst case only discovered in the final stage: Testing. This paper outlines an approach for constructive requirements modeling, which describes completely a customer's demands in a formal manner so that already during the requirements' elicitation inconsistencies are eliminated, completeness is assessed, realizability is ensured, and all valid test cases can be derived by using a model-based testing approach. Therefore, we propose adaptions to the traditional V-model to not only save valuable development and testing time but also to achieve better results. The applicability is shown on the example of the software for an auxiliary heating system at a large German OEM.","tags":null,"title":"Constructive Requirements Modeling -- More Reliable Implementations in a Shorter Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berger, Christian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1349049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349049600,"objectID":"a615a2c20df077e47003e4111f784fd7","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/ber12c/","publishdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ber12c/","section":"publication","summary":"Cyber-physical systems are nowadays used as the term for systems which perceive data from their surroundings for algorithmic processing and enrichment by digital information to generate interactions in their specific context.

The development of these complex and interconnected systems requires the combined utilization of simulations and test-runs in reality to assess the system's quality and to increase the developer's and customer's confidence in the resulting implementation. The combination of interactive as well as unattended simulated system tests has to be in tight coordination with their real counterparts to derive reliable results on the one hand and to save valuable resources on the other hand.

While the first two challenges in 2004 and 2005 dealt with driving in unknown and rough environments without any moving obstacles, the challenge in 2007 increased the overall complexity by requiring correct and safe handling of moving vehicles from other competing autonomous vehicles in an urban setting. The first competition held in 2004 afforded no winner, while the repeated competition in 2005 produced five vehicles which finished the entire course from which four stayed under the ten hour time limit; Stanley the vehicle which was developed at Stanford University was the winner of this first international competition. After a period of less than two years, the community achieved the increased requirements for dealing with real urban-like traffic and afforded six autonomous vehicles from 89 applicants which finished the course within the timelimit. This chapter gives a short overview of the history of the Grand Challenges, discusses the background of the Urban Challenge, as well as goes over high level rules and the qualifying process. The remaining chapters in the book cover aspects of the development of autonomous vehicles ranging from appropriate sensor technology and setup, over reliable detection of the vehicle's surroundings, up to evaluating the environment for deriving a driving decision are covered in the following chapters. Besides, proper software and system development methods are discussed as well.","tags":null,"title":"Introduction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berger, Christian and Rumpe, Bernhard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1346457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1346457600,"objectID":"be5a37cb09305f175aef4ae49933ee90","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/br12b/","publishdate":"2012-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/br12b/","section":"publication","summary":"In November 2007 the international competition DARPA Urban Challenge took place on the former George Airforce Base in Victorville, California to significantly promote the research and development on autonomously driving vehicles for urban environments.

As long as vehicle functions dominate which are executed exclusively on separated ECUs, there is only a limited demand for runtime adaption. However, as soon as several vehicle functions are grouped to run on one ECU or one vehicle function is composed by several independent software components, runtime adaption is getting increasingly interesting regarding energy-efficiency for example. In this paper, a concept of self-adaption for AUTOSAR is outlined on the example of a collision detection and warning system.

In this paper we present the formalization of requirements by models to simulate the expected field usage of a system.

The gen- eration can be controlled with operational profiles that describe different classes of field usage. We have applied our approach at a large German car manufacturer in the early development phase of active safety functionalities.

However, establishing a software product line for integrating already existing legacy software to reuse valuable resources for future similar products is very company-specific.

One main reason is the early dependency on all sensor's raw data to setup the data processing chain and to identify subsystems. These sensors' data might be extensive, especially if laser scanners or color camera systems are continuously producing a vast amount of raw data. Moreover, due to this dependency the sensors' setup including their respectively specified mounting positions and calibration information is also necessary to gather real input data from real surroundings' situations of the system. This is even more important before actually starting to integrate independently developed subsystems for carrying out tests for the entire data processing chain. To reduce this dependency and therefore to decouple tasks from the project's critical path, an approach is outlined in this thesis which was developed to support the software engineering for sensor- and actuator-based autonomous systems. This approach relies on customer's requirements and corresponding customer's acceptance criteria as well as the decoupling of the software engineering from the real hardware environment to allow appropriate system simulations. Based on the customer's requirements, formally specified scenarios using a domain specific language are derived which are used to provide surroundings and suitable situations for a sensor- and actuator-based autonomous system. From these formally specified surroundings, the required input data is derived for different layers of a sensor data processing system to generate actions within the system's context. This input data itself depends on a given sensor model to compute its specific raw data. Amongst others, on the example of laser scanners and camera systems, algorithms using modern graphical processing units are outlined to generate the required raw data even for complex situations. To realize the aforementioned aspects, a development environment is necessary consisting of tools for modeling and working with instances of a domain specific language. Furthermore, a software framework is required which provides easily usable and mature solutions for common programming requirements like synchronization for concurrent threads or communication in a high-level point of view. For relying on a consistent and homogeneous software framework for implementing the concepts, a highly portable and real-time-capable software framework for distributed applications was realized which was written entirely from scratch in strictly object-oriented C++. Moreover, this software framework also integrates the formally modeled input data derived from the specified requirements and the sensors' models to allow unattended system simulations to support the acceptance tests for subsystems or an entire system. On the example of autonomous vehicles, the applicability of the approach and the software framework is demonstrated by implementing a vehicle navigation algorithm which uses a given digital map for finding the best route to a desired destination from an arbitrarily chosen starting point. This algorithm was developed considering the test-first-principle and is continuously evaluated by unattended and automatic software tests which are executed on a continuous integration system. Its implementation as well as its evaluation make use of the aforementioned concepts and algorithms. Therefore, the vehicle's surroundings were formally modeled together with its necessary sensors using the provided development tools and environment for performing and evaluating unattended system runs before the algorithm was put into operation on the real vehicle.","tags":null,"title":"Automating Acceptance Tests for Sensor- and Actuator-based Systems on the Example of Autonomous Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengi, Cem and Babur, Önder and Rendel, Holger and Berger, Christian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1275350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1275350400,"objectID":"0fe146b0f1c4c04ebbfb9b718945bcf6","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/mbrb10/","publishdate":"2010-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mbrb10/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent efforts in the automotive domain to initiate a para- digm-shift from a traditional hardware-driven to a function-driven development process create new challenges to tackle. A hardware-driven variant handling mechanism will get more and more inappropriate. Instead, new concepts and methods are necessary to model and configure concrete systems. A software document which is used in the early phase of development is the so called function net model. Variability in function nets is captured implicitly and is strongly dependent on the hardware infrastructure, constraints are collected with informal annotations, and variants are generated manually. This results in a situation where function nets get too complex, time consuming and unsuitable for future standards. In this paper, we will present a model-driven approach for function nets to capture variability explicitly, to express formal constraints, and to generate concrete variants with the support of an automated configuration process. By this, it is possible to use the generated variants as skeletons for virtual prototyping, so that requirement specifications can be verified efficiently.","tags":null,"title":"Model-driven Configuration of Function Net Families in Automotive Software Engineering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berger, Christian and Rumpe, Bernhard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1275350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1275350400,"objectID":"45abaa940c8a1190917729ab25e785b7","permalink":"https://chrberger.github.io/publication/br10/","publishdate":"2010-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/br10/","section":"publication","summary":"Many system-development projects today are mainly driven by the complexity of their software interacting with sensors or actuators in an embedded context.

This especially holds for a project building an intelligent autonomously driving car to participate in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. In this article, we present essential elements of a software and systems engineering process for the development of artificial intelligence capable of driving autonomously in complex urban situations. The process includes agile concepts, like test first approach, continuous integration of every software module and a reliable release and configuration management assisted by software tools in integrated development environments. However, the most important ingredients for an efficient and stringent development are the ability to efficiently test the behavior of the developed system in a flexible and modular simulator for urban situations.","tags":null,"title":"Software \u0026 Systems Engineering Process and Tools for the Development of Autonomous Driving Intelligence","type":"publication"}]
