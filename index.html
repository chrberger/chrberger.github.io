      </h3>

      <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
        
        Companies developing and maintaining software-only products like web shops aim for establishing persistent links to their software running in the field. Monitoring data from real usage scenarios allows for a number of improvements in the software life-cycle, such as quick identification and solution of issues, and elicitation of requirements from previously unexpected usage. While the processes of continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation using sandboxing technologies are becoming well established in said software-only products, adopting similar practices for the automotive domain is more complex mainly due to real-time and safety constraints. In this paper, we systematically evaluate sandboxed software deployment in the context of a self-driving heavy vehicle that participated in the 2016 Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge (GCDC) in The Netherlands. We measured the system&#39;s scheduling precision after deploying applications in four different execution environments. Our results indicate that there is no significant difference in performance and overhead when sandboxed environments are used compared to natively deployed software. Thus, recent trends in software architecting, packaging, and maintenance using microservices encapsulated in sandboxes will help to realize similar software and system engineering for cyber-physical systems.

      </h3>

      <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
        
        The validation of simulation models (e.g., of electronic control units for vehicles) in industry is becoming increasingly challenging due to their growing complexity. To systematically assess the quality of such models, software metrics seem to be promising. In this paper we explore the use of software metrics and outlier analysis as a means to assess the quality of model-based software. More specifically, we investigate how results from regression analysis applied to measurement data received from size and complexity metrics can be mapped to software quality. Using the moving averages approach, models were fit to data received from over 65,000 software revisions for 71 simulation models that represent different electronic control units of real premium vehicles. Consecutive investigations using studentized deleted residuals and Cook&#39;s Distance revealed outliers among the measurements. From these outliers we identified a subset, which provides meaningful information (anomalies) by comparing outlier scores with expert opinions. Eight engineers were interviewed separately for outlier impact on software quality. Findings were validated in consecutive workshops. The results show correlations between outliers and their impact on four of the considered quality characteristics. They also demonstrate the applicability of this approach in industry.

      </h3>

      <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
        
        Self-driving vehicles for commercial use cases like logistics or overcast mines increase their owners&#39; economic competitiveness. Volvo maintains, evolves, and distributes a vehicle control product line for different brands like Volvo Trucks, Renault, and Mack in more than 190 markets world-wide. From the different application domains of their customers originates the need for a multi-domain reference architecture concerned with transport mission planning, execution, and tracking on top of the vehicle control product line. This industrial case study is the first of its kind reporting about the systematic process to design such a reference architecture involving all relevant external and internal stakeholders, development documents, low-level artifacts, and literature. Quantitative and qualitative metrics were applied to evaluate non-functional requirements on the reference architecture level before a concrete variant was evaluated using a Volvo FMX truck in an exemplary construction site setting.

      </h3>

      <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
        
        Agile software development is increasingly adopted by companies evolving and maintaining software products to support better planning and tracking the realization of user stories and features. While convincing success stories help to further spread the adoption of Agile, mechatronics-driven companies need guidance to implement Agile for non-software teams. In this comparative case study of three companies from the Nordic region, we systematically investigate expectations and challenges from scaling Agile in organizations dealing with mechatronics development by conducting on-site workshops and surveys. Our findings show that all companies have already successfully implemented Agile in their software teams. The expected main benefit of successfully scaling agile development is a faster time-to-market product development; however, the two main challenges are: (a) An inflexible test environment that inhibits fast feedback to changed or added features, and (b) the existing organizational structure including the company&#39;s mind-set that needs to be opened-up for agile principles.
